# Performance Optimization 
This repository contain tips, tutorials and examples on performance optimisation.

## Simple tips to improve the performance of your code (no matter what programming language you are using).

1. Build with optimisations enabled (and debug off).
2. Don’t print or log in performance critical areas (avoid IO).
3. Don’t calculate the same thing more than once.
4. Minimise memory allocations.
5. Avoid copying data (pass references to it).
6. Store data as close to the data that it is used with as possible.
7. Iterate through arrays in order, when possible, don’t jump around.
